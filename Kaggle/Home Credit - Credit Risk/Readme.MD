### CSV vs Parquet Files

CSV files are used for row storage, whereas Parquet files are used for column storage
  
1. Parquet uses efficient data compression and encoding scheme for fast data storing and retrieval
2. Parquet files have a .parquet extension and are represented in binary form, which means that they cannot be opened and examined with a simple text editor
3. Converting your CSV data to Parquetâ€™s columnar format and then compressing and dividing it will help you save a lot of money
   and also achieve better performance
